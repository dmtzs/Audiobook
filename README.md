## Audiobook wit python

## The project
This is an desktop application in which we can read a PDF and transform the text of the PDF into 
a voice that will read you all the PDF as a audiobook so if you have a tale or something like that 
it can be readed with this program.

## Installation, libraries and considerations
- For its correct installation and edition directly using code you need first python 3 installed in your computer.
- Run the next command in order to install all libraries we need for the program:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- If you dont want to use code and install anything then please download directly the exe file by [clicking here]() and 
then just run the program after unziping the file.
